# Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves importing, cleaning, and analyzing a dataset containing salary information for various job titles within the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. The main objective is to uncover insights regarding salary distributions, experience levels, and job categories across different locations and years.

## Data Importing
The dataset "Data_Analyst_Data.csv" is loaded using pandas. Essential libraries such as matplotlib, plotly, numpy, and seaborn are used for data manipulation and visualization.

## Data Cleaning
The initial steps include checking for null values, duplicates, and ensuring data integrity. The dataset comprises 9355 rows and 12 columns, with some duplicate entries identified and addressed.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Unique Job Titles**: Identification of unique job titles to understand the diversity in the dataset.
- **Salary Analysis**: Examination of average salaries across different job titles, experience levels, and years.
- **Top Job Titles**: Identification of top job titles by count and by average salary in specific locations.
- **Experience Level Analysis**: Analysis of job distribution across different experience levels.

## Visualization
Several visualizations are created to illustrate:
- The distribution of job titles across different locations.
- Average salaries for top job titles across different years.
- The frequency of job titles across different experience levels.

## Conclusions
- High-paying regions and job titles are identified, offering strategic insights for job seekers in Data Science and AI.
- The importance of focusing on skill development in high-demand areas is emphasized.

## Strategies for Job Seekers
- Aim for jobs in high-paying regions like the US, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and Bosnia.
- Focus on acquiring specialized skills in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.
- Consider emerging markets for competitive salaries with potentially less competition.
