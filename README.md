Objective: We start by clearly defining what we aim to achieve with this analysis.
Data Source: Next, we explain where our data comes from and why it’s reliable.
Data Prep: We detail how we've cleaned and organized the data for analysis.
Analysis: We present our analysis, supported by visual aids, to highlight key trends and figures.
Findings: We summarize our main discoveries and offer insights for data professionals.
Next Steps: Lastly, we suggest areas for further research or action based on our findings.

4. How have the number of jobs in the job category evolved annually across different company locations from 2020 to 2023?
5. What are the salary trends across different job titles and categories, and how do these trends reflect on the average, median, minimum, and maximum salaries?

Data Set Analysis Process
Grouping data by 'work_year', 'company_location', and 'job_category' and counting occurrences helped us understand:

Yearly Trends: How the interest in different data jobs has  changed over  each year.

Location Popularity:  Enabled us to know where certain data jobs were more common.

Career Insights: Showed us  the growth in various job titles and categories, therefore,  providing a guide with career decisions.

Popular Data Jobs:  Helped Identify the different data roles that are in demand.
